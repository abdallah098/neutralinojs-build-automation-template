## Overview

Welcome to the **Neutralino.js Build Automation Template**. This repository provides a straightforward template for building cross-platform applications using Neutralino.js. It supports Windows, Mac, and Linux environments, allowing developers to streamline their workflow and focus on creating great applications.

You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/abdallah098/neutralinojs-build-automation-template/releases). Download and execute the necessary files to get started.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Build applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **Automated Build Process**: Save time with a streamlined build automation setup.
- **Custom Configuration**: Easily modify the configuration to suit your needs.
- **Installer Generation**: Create installers for different platforms, including AppImage for Linux and Inno Setup for Windows.
- **Template Structure**: Start with a well-organized project structure that adheres to best practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Neutralino.js CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdallah098/neutralinojs-build-automation-template.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd neutralinojs-build-automation-template
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

The configuration files are located in the `config` directory. You can modify these files to customize your build process. Here are some key files to look at:

- **neutralino.config.json**: Main configuration file for Neutralino.js.
- **build.config.json**: Configuration for the build automation process.

### Building Your Application

To build your application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will trigger the build automation process and generate the necessary files for your application.

### Generating Installers

After building your application, you can generate installers for your target platforms.

- For **Windows**, use Inno Setup:

  ```bash
  npm run build:windows
  ```

- For **Linux**, create an AppImage:

  ```bash
  npm run build:linux
  ```

### Running Your Application

To run your application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open your application in the default web browser.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes topics relevant to modern application development:

- **AppImage**: A format for packaging applications on Linux.
- **Automation**: Streamlining processes to improve efficiency.
- **Build Tool**: Tools that help automate the build process.
- **Bundler**: Packages your application and its dependencies.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Creating applications that run on multiple operating systems.
